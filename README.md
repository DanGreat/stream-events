# How i approach solving my problem

In approaching the project I had to study the requirement needed which was to enable users
see an overview of upcoming events and fixtures. So that they donâ€™t miss the next match of my favourite sports team.

1, I thought out what CSS framework to use, so I went with Bootstrap
2, I choose to use also the Bootstrap icon library
3, For a litte fade effects on the events list I used Animate.css library
4, Added the HttpClientModule to my app.module.ts file to enable me fetch request from an API

# How i verified my solution worked correctly

1, I tested the API endpoint using post-man to be sure it was a request i could fetch records from
2, Using Chrome's browser debugging tool, I inspected some stylings not properly being applied
3, For every functions created i ensured it was doing the required action

# How long i spent on the excercise

I spent relatively 5 to 6 hours making this excercise

# What i would add if you had more time and how?

I believe with the design immplemented i would not add anything more

# To setup the application

1, Extract the zip files into an empty directory
2, Open the directory with your VS code and open up your terminal
3, Alternatively to `step 2` you can open the directory in any terminal
4, Run `npm i` to install the dependencies to the projects
5 Run `ng serve -o` to serve it up to your browser
